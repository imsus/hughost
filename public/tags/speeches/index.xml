      <title>The Purpose of Education</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I engage in the so-called &amp;ldquo;bull sessions&amp;rdquo; around and about the school, I too
often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of
education. Most of the &amp;ldquo;brethren&amp;rdquo; think that education should equip them with
the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the
masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends
rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of
man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must
enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the
ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To
think incisively and to think for one&amp;rsquo;s self is very difficult. We are prone to
let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and
propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling
its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think
logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and
the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To
save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims
of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern
the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from
the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and
to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the
greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted
with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of
Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all
measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he
contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we
call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus
character&amp;ndash;that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one
not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to
concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the
accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of
social living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded,
unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful,
&amp;ldquo;brethren!&amp;rdquo; Be careful, teachers!&lt;/p&gt;
