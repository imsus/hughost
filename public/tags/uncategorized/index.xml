      <description>&lt;p&gt;An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on
doctor’s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the
first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with
just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin
tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said
as he unloaded them into a basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But… What do you do with the rest of your time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my
children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each
evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy
life, señor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help
you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger
boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul.
Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell
directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would
control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this
small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los
Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you could run your expanded
enterprise with proper management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which the American replied, “15-20 years, 25 tops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But what then, señor?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right,
you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become
very rich. You would make millions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Millions señor? Then what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you
would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your
wife, and stroll in to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and
play your guitar with your amigos.”&lt;/p&gt;
